## Workplace mandates: 'problems' that are out of your team's hands

Usually, the bigger the company, the more problems that are out of your hands at
work. There may be mandates, restrictions and requirements that are from above
that you may not understand. They may impact your daily work drastically even if
they do not bring any positive traits at work.

## Step aside and give respect

Everyone in your team and your company are in the same team. Life is an active
PvP game and it is very valuable to keep your allies as allies. Work place
mandates and requirements are (mostly) not coincidental and have a very specific
intended effect.

Your ally spent their time creating the mandate because there was an org-wide
problem. It is very easy to get trapped into denouncing such effort, do not fall
into this trap.

## Understand the mandates' effect

Collect data about the effect of the mandate: how it impacts daily work life,
cost change, morale impact, etc. Talk to wide range of people and you should
spend your time to understand various perspectives.

Document these effects in written form and share it privately with stakeholders.

## Talk to your manager

Talk to your manager. Discuss the impacts and see what you can do. Most of the
time, nothing. You are going to keep poking up the chain until you find the
answer you want. Communicate this fact with the manager (who ideally shares the
frustrations that you and your colleagues have) who is on your side.

## Talk to your manager's manager

Talk to someone above your manager. Understand their feedback in and out to
understand their perspective of the story. Derive if you got the answer.

## Keep poking above

If you did not get the answer, keep going up the chain. You've hopefully made
allies as you climbed up. You can also go side the chain (ex. talking to a
director in your sister team) who may be in the best interest to keep your
team's productivity high.

I've personally had to go up to VP level to get the answer I wanted. The
experience was smooth overall with surprising positive responses.
