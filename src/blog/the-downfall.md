<h1>The downfall of tech and preparation</h1>
<div class="center">2023-01-22</div>

## The premise

I've always wanted to be a SWE ever since I first played my first MMO. Tech-savy
family members tried to stop me, since SWEs back in the day were treated like
absolute peasants with shit pay. They obviously have failed.

I got extremely lucky that I started my career in the middle of the tech boom.
Although I was grateful, IMO, BigTech paying ridiculous amount of compensation
made sense only until they 'corporatified' themselves in terms of size and
operation.

## Current situation

Here is a list of personally-interested recent layoffs:

- Google, 12000, 2023/01/20
- Wayfair, 1750, 2023/01/20
- Microsoft, 10000, 2023/01/18
- Coinbase, 950, 2023/01/10
- Amazon, 8000, 2023/01/04

The community, including myself, is expecting layoffs to continue throughout the
year.

Cash in hand remains strong for some companies (Microsoft, Google) but not for
many (Meta, Amazon, Netflix).

There is no objective data on the layoffs. The probably will never be one. From
digging LinkedIn and Blind, it seems like non-SWEs (recruiters, TPMs, etc) were
impacted the most. Most SWEs who got laid off seem to be relatively new to the
company (1~2 years of tenure). I have no objective data to prove this.

## My predictions

Without much proof to back it up this post, I foresee the recession to start
easing off around 2023Q4 and economic growth to resume around 2024Q4.

Given this, my predictions:

- Meta will have a major layoff and reduction in size, I don't see a way for
  them to accelerate their returns for their investments in VR/MR to power
  through the recession. The cash in hand doesn't seem enough to survive without
  any major layoffs. I expect the company size to reduce by 60% (vs covid peak)
  at minimum.
- BigTech will focus on expansion to cheaper countries (ie. outside US).
- A lot of current startups will die, and lots of new ones will start. The new
  startup scene will now focus on sustainability and profitability instead of
  focusing on being bought off by BigTech.
- IC compensation growth and awards will remain high as long as BigTech
  continues the layoffs.
- All exiting BigTech will be come 'the next IBM/Oracle'. New version of BigTech
  will rise. Simply because innovation cannot happen anymore at the pace that it
  used to be in BigTech.
- 2023-2024 will be the year to be sold to BigTech. A lot of them are holding
  onto their cash for a reason and they know their pace of innovation has
  dwindled compared to 2010s.
- End of war in Europe will greatly help the tech industry and the US politics
  around. I have no clue if it will ever end by 2024 though.

## Preparing

- Be under the management chain who can give you the work experience that you
  want. Ideally, this should stretch up to your department's VP level. Keep them
  happy and they'll shield you from BS.
- Be actually good at the job. As much as I hate to say it, there are tonnes of
  engineers in BigTech who are terrible at everything other than writing descent
  code or designing simple systems.
- Lower your cost of living, obviously. Consider working remotely in a more
  affordable area. Buy a home to live in, if you haven't already.

Good luck to 2023-2024 graduates, consider doing more studies if you can afford
to.

## Long-term thinking

- Don't make working in BigTech one of your personalities.
- Grow your career in the pace you can manage. Know when to pause and take time
  to digest. Unless you are buddies with the SVPs, you are just a cog in the
  machine.

I guess TL;DR for this is, stay humble and don't let your ego consume you.
